# Potato OS

[![License: Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Experimental Raspberry Pi Linux mod with optimised local LLM inference. Runs quantised models on-device with a browser chat UI — no cloud, no GPU, just a Pi.

*Potato sold separately.*

**Supports Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB / 16 GB) and Raspberry Pi 4 (8 GB).** Pi 5 is the recommended target (~8 tok/sec). Pi 4 works but expect roughly 1/4 of the speed.

## Qwen3-30B-A3B running on a Pi 5 (8 GB) with an SSD — slightly throttling.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/demo-chat.gif" alt="Potato OS demo — Qwen3-30B running on Raspberry Pi 5" width="100%"></p>

**Runtime:** [ik_llama.cpp](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp) (IQK-optimised, Pi 5) + upstream [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) (Pi 4 / Pi 5) | **Default model:** Qwen3.5-2B (Pi 5), Qwen3.5-0.8B (Pi 4)

## Install (recommended)

1. Download the latest SD card image from [Releases](https://github.com/potato-os/core/releases)
2. Flash it to a microSD card with [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
3. Insert the card, power on the Pi, and wait for first boot to complete
4. Open `http://potato.local` in a browser

A starter model downloads automatically on first boot (~1.8 GB on Pi 5, ~0.5 GB on Pi 4). Chat is ready once the download finishes and the status shows CONNECTED.

See [Flashing Guide](docs/flashing.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions, including how to flash directly from Raspberry Pi Imager without a manual download.

### What you need

- Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB or 16 GB) or Raspberry Pi 4 (8 GB)
- microSD card (16 GB minimum)
- Power supply (20W USB-C minimum, 27W recommended if using a USB SSD)
- Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection (for first-boot model download)

### Performance

| Device | Model | Speed | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Pi 5 (8 GB) | [Qwen3-30B-A3B](https://huggingface.co/byteshape/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-GGUF) Q3_K_S (2.66 bpw, ~10 GB) | **~8-9 tok/sec** | 30B MoE with SSD offload, ik_llama |
| Pi 5 (8 GB) | Qwen3.5-2B Q4_K_M | ~7.8 tok/sec | ik_llama runtime |
| Pi 4 (8 GB) | Qwen3.5-0.8B IQ4_NL | ~5 tok/sec | llama.cpp universal |
| Pi 4 (8 GB) | Qwen3-30B-A3B Q3_K_S | ~2 tok/sec | 30B on 8 GB RAM |

The standout: **30B-parameter Qwen3-30B-A3B** (mixture-of-experts, only 3B active) runs at full conversational speed on Pi 5 with a USB SSD. That's a frontier-class model on a $80 board.

## MVP status

Potato OS is an early release meant for testing and tinkering, not production use.

### What works

- Chat with streaming responses
- Vision — attach a photo and ask about it
- Multi-chat sessions (persisted in your browser)
- Model management — download by URL, upload, delete, switch active model
- System monitoring — CPU, GPU, temperature, memory, storage, power draw
- Dual inference runtime — ik_llama (Pi 5 default) and upstream llama.cpp (Pi 4 default, Pi 5 fallback)

Updates are reflash-only for now — there is no OTA or in-place upgrade path yet.

## Recovery and rollback

Need to back out or recover from a failed setup? See [docs/recovery.md](docs/recovery.md) for the practical rollback paths for:

- restoring a previous Raspberry Pi OS or other system image
- reflashing to a newer Potato OS image

## Development

Everything below is for contributors and developers.

### Local dev

```bash
uv sync
POTATO_ENABLE_ORCHESTRATOR=0 uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 1983
```

### Tests

```bash
uv run python -m pytest tests/unit tests/api -q -n auto
npx playwright test --reporter=dot --timeout=15000 --workers=75%
```

### Building llama runtimes

Runtimes are built on the Pi (aarch64, no cross-compilation). From your Mac:

```bash
# Build both ik_llama + llama_cpp from latest source on Pi, sync back
./bin/build_and_publish_remote.sh

# Build + publish to GitHub Releases
./bin/build_and_publish_remote.sh --publish

# Just one family
./bin/build_and_publish_remote.sh --family ik_llama
```

This SSHs to `potato.local` (default: `pi`/`raspberry`), clones latest source, builds, and syncs the binaries back. Use `--publish` to upload tarballs to GitHub Releases.

Or build directly on the Pi:

```bash
./bin/build_llama_runtime.sh --family both --fetch --clean
```

Published runtimes are available at [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/potato-os/core/releases). Fresh installs auto-download when no local build is present:

```bash
POTATO_LLAMA_RELEASE_AUTO=1 ./bin/install_dev.sh
```

### SD card images

Build a flashable Potato OS image from macOS:

```bash
./bin/build_local_image.sh --setup-docker
```

See [Building Images](docs/building-images.md) for prerequisites, variants, flashing, and publishing releases.

### Project

- Board: [github.com/orgs/potato-os/projects/1](https://github.com/orgs/potato-os/projects/1)
- Defaults: hostname `potato`, SSH `pi`/`raspberry`
