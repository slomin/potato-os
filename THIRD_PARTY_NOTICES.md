## Keeping this file current

When adding or updating a vendored component:

1. Update the relevant section above (version, copyright years, license text).
2. Verify the license text matches the upstream LICENSE file.
3. For runtime builds, `bin/build_llama_runtime.sh` copies the upstream LICENSE
   into each runtime slot automatically.
4. OTA tarballs include this file via `bin/publish_ota_release.sh`.
