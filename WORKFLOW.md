# Potato OS Workflow Guide

This is the single source of truth for how we plan, execute, and close work.

## Project Board

- Board: <https://github.com/users/slomin/projects/8>
- Default status flow:
  - `Todo`
  - `In Progress`
  - `QA`
  - `In Review`
  - `Done`

## Labels

- Type: `type:feature`, `type:bug`, `type:chore`
- Area: `area:ui`, `area:backend`, `area:pi-image`, `area:ops`
- State: `blocked` (use when waiting on an external dependency)

## Ticket Lifecycle

1. Create an issue (succinct and outcome-focused).
2. Add labels (`type:*` + `area:*`).
3. Add issue to the `Potato OS` project and set `Status=Todo`.
4. Assign issue owner before any branch work starts.
5. Create branch from `main` using:
   - `feat/issue-<id>-<short-slug>` for features
   - `fix/issue-<id>-<short-slug>` for bugs
6. Move issue to `In Progress` once branch is created.
7. Open PR linked to the issue.
8. Move to `QA` when implementation is complete and ready for Pi validation.
9. Move to `In Review` after QA passes and PR is ready.
10. Merge PR (squash preferred).
11. Close issue and set project item to `Done`.

## Branching Rules (Required)

- Never implement ticket work on `main`.
- `main` is merge-only; no direct commits for feature/bug/chore work.
- Before writing code, confirm branch: `git branch --show-current`.
- Required branch naming: `feat/issue-<id>-<short-slug>`, `fix/issue-<id>-<short-slug>`, `chore/issue-<id>-<short-slug>`.
- Start every ticket branch from latest `main`: `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only && git checkout -b <branch-name>`.

## Ticket Quality Standard (Required)

Every implementation ticket must include:
- clear Summary
- explicit Scope
- measurable Acceptance criteria
- explicit Non-goals
- TDD-first requirement
- Test expectations by layer (unit/API/UI as applicable)

## TDD Rule

All feature tickets are implemented TDD-first:
1. Write failing tests first.
2. Implement minimal code to pass.
3. Refactor with tests green.
4. Include test commands/output in PR description.
5. Keep commit history readable:
   - tests-first commit (or clearly isolated test diff),
   - implementation commit,
   - docs/runbook updates commit.

## PR Readiness Checklist

Before moving `QA` -> `In Review`, PR description must include:
- `Closes #<issue-id>` (or equivalent linked issue statement)
- status/risk notes and rollback guidance
- exact commands run
- summarized test output for unit/API/UI layers touched
- any workflow/runbook changes made from lessons learned

## Real Pi QA (Required For Pi-Impacting Work)

If a ticket changes runtime behavior on device (API behavior, model orchestration, install scripts, nginx/systemd, or UI behavior tied to live backend), PRs must include QA on a real Pi.

- QA is the gate: do not move to `In Review` until QA is completed, unless explicitly labeled `blocked`.
- PR description must include:
  - who performed QA,
  - device/host used (prefer `potato.local`; avoid personal IPs in docs/PR text),
  - short scenario list and pass/fail result.
- Automated Pi scripts are supporting evidence only (optional but recommended), for example:
  - `./tests/e2e/smoke_pi.sh`
  - `./tests/e2e/seed_mode_pi.sh`

## Post-Merge Closeout

- verify the project item moved to `Done`
- verify issue is closed by merge
- capture any process improvements in `WORKFLOW.md` in the same change set (when applicable)

## Starter Issue Template

Use this structure for new implementation tickets:

```md
### Summary
<1-2 lines>

### Implementation requirement
This ticket must be developed **TDD-first**.

### Scope
- ...

### Acceptance criteria
- ...

### Test expectations (required)
- Unit:
- API:
- UI/e2e:

### Non-goals
- ...
```

## Helpful CLI snippets

```bash
# Create issue
gh issue create -R slomin/potato-os --title "<title>" --body-file <file.md> --label "type:feature" --label "area:backend"

# Add issue to project
gh project item-add 8 --owner slomin --url https://github.com/slomin/potato-os/issues/<id>

# Show current status option IDs before editing item status
gh project field-list 8 --owner slomin --format json | jq -r '.fields[] | select(.name=="Status") | .options[] | "\(.name): \(.id)"'

# Move item status using the current option ID (Todo/In Progress/QA/In Review/Done)
gh project item-edit --id <item-id> --project-id PVT_kwHOABrb5c4BP912 --field-id PVTSSF_lAHOABrb5c4BP912zg-OMzk --single-select-option-id <current-option-id>
```
